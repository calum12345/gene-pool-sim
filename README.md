# readme

so i had a science project where i had to pick out some genes and stuff for fish and this is a larger scale simulation of that

green alleles are dominant to all alleles

yellow and red are codominant and a fish that has both yellow and red alleles is orange

all yellow fish have a 10% chance of dying at end of generation

## plans for future

- add csv compatibility
- add tests
- add *the environmental disaster*
